Data science is the key to making this flood of information useful. Simply put,
data science is the art of wrangling data to predict our future behavior, uncover
pattern to help prioritize or provide actionable information, or otherwise draw
meaning from thest vast, untapped data resources.

What's the point of all this data?
Why use valuable resources to generate and collect it?

Specialists known as data engineers are constantly finding innovative and
powerful new ways to capture, collate and condense unimaginably massive
volumes of data, and other specialists, known as data scientists, are leading
change by deriving valuable and actionable insights from that data.

Data science relies heavily on a practitioner's math skills (and statistics
skills, as described in the following section) precisely because these are the
skills needed to understand your data and its significance. These skills are
also valuable in data science because you can use them to carry out predictive
forecasting, decision modeling, and hypotheses testing.

Coding is unavoidable when you're working in data science. You need to be able
to write code so that you can instruct the computer how you want it to
manipulate, analyze, and visualize your data. Programming languages such as
Python and R are important for writing scripts for data manipulation,
analaysis, and visualization, and SQL is useful for data querying. The
JavaScript library D3.js is a hot new option for marking cool, custom, and
interactive web-based data visualizations.
